# Desktop Organiser
If your desktop is always cluttered and filled with icons (like mine), here is a simple Python script to solve your issues.
This Desktop Organiser creates folders (like photos, videos, music and more) and moves your files into it.
Apart from this, a folder called ***ancient*** is created. Files older than a year (this duration can be configured) are moved into it. Studies done by [@shobhit-coder](https://github.com/shobhit-coder/) show that most desktop files are typically those that are unused for a long time and users are typically lazy to move them around. The ancient folder is there to do just that. :P So, check your ancient files and move them if necessary.

## Requirements
python 3.x
## Usage

 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Run *script.py*
 3. Optionally: You may change the directories and file extensions that are best suited for your needs. This can be done by modifying *config.json*.

# TO-DO
1. Factor in click frequency (rather than date last modified) to move files into the ancient directory.
2. Sort shortcuts into various categories by searching them online.
